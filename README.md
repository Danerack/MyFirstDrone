# MyFirstDrone
Hi there, this is my first time designing a drone.

[25/6/2025] Hi there, today is the first day of me designing my drone. So far the only thing I have done was studying drone theory. It aint much but it's progress. My plans for to day is just to figure everything / most of what my drone will have. Welp here goes nothing! 

For anyone wondering I'm following Riley Morgans Drone Theory
